### **AWS ECS Overview**  

#### **1. What is AWS ECS?**  
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker. ECS integrates with AWS services like IAM, ELB, and CloudWatch for security, networking, and monitoring.  

#### **2. Benefits of Using ECS**  
- **Fully Managed**: No need to manage the underlying infrastructure.  
- **Deep AWS Integration**: Works seamlessly with AWS services (IAM, CloudWatch, ALB, etc.).  
- **Security**: Uses AWS IAM roles for granular access control.  
- **Scalability**: Easily scale containers up or down based on demand.  
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the resources you use, especially with Fargate.  
- **Flexibility**: Supports both EC2 and Fargate launch types for different use cases.  

#### **3. ECS vs. EKS , Kubernetes**  

| Feature              | Amazon ECS                             | Amazon EKS                             | Kubernetes                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Management**       | Fully managed by AWS                   | Fully managed by AWS                   | Requires hands-on management              |
| **Integration**      | Seamlessly integrates with AWS services| Seamlessly integrates with AWS services| Works across various cloud providers and on-premises |
| **Ease of Use**      | Easier to set up and use               | Easier to use if familiar with Kubernetes| More complex to set up and manage         |
| **Security**         | Built-in security features             | Built-in security features             | Security features depend on implementation|

| **Cost**             | Can be cost-effective with AWS spot instances | Can incur additional costs due to Kubernetes complexity | Can incur additional costs due to complexity and resource usage |
| **Learning Curve**   | Lower learning curve                   | Higher learning curve than ECS, lower than native Kubernetes | Higher learning curve                     |

### **Key Differences**
- **ECS**: Best for those who want an easy-to-use, fully managed service that's integrated with AWS. It’s ideal for simpler workloads and smaller teams.
- **EKS**: Offers the flexibility and power of Kubernetes but with the added benefit of being fully managed by AWS. Good for teams familiar with Kubernetes who want to leverage AWS services.
- **Kubernetes**: Best for those who need maximum flexibility and are willing to manage and maintain their own infrastructure. Suitable for complex, multi-cloud, or on-premises deployments.

#### **4. Core Components of ECS**  
- **Clusters**: Logical grouping of ECS services or tasks.  
- **Task Definitions**: Blueprint defining how a container should run (CPU, memory, image, etc.).  
- **Tasks**: Running instances of a task definition.  
- **Services**: Ensure a specific number of tasks are running and handle scaling.  
- **Container Agent**: Runs on EC2 instances to manage ECS tasks (not required for Fargate).  

#### **5. ECS Architecture**  
- **ECS Control Plane**: Manages cluster state and scheduling.  
- **Compute Layer**: EC2 instances (ECS-optimized AMIs) or AWS Fargate.  
- **Task Execution**: ECS tasks run based on task definitions.  
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Integrated with Route 53, ALB, NLB.  
- **Security & Monitoring**: Uses IAM roles, AWS CloudWatch, and AWS CloudTrail.  

#### **6. ECS Launch Types: EC2 vs. Fargate**  

| Feature       | EC2 Launch Type | Fargate Launch Type |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Infrastructure** | Requires EC2 instances | Serverless, AWS manages infra |
| **Scaling**  | Manual or Auto Scaling | Automatic scaling |
| **Security** | Requires IAM roles for EC2 | IAM roles at the task level |
| **Cost**     | Pay for EC2 instances | Pay only for container runtime |
| **Use Case** | Best for existing EC2 workloads | Ideal for fully managed, serverless deployments |



### **Deploying a Microservice Application on AWS ECS**  
### **1. Create the Task Definition**  
A **Task Definition** is like a blueprint for how your containerized application runs in ECS.  

#### **Steps to Create a Task Definition**:  
1. Go to the **AWS ECS Console** → **Task Definitions** → **Create new Task Definition**.  
2. Choose **Fargate** or **EC2** as the launch type.  
3. Define **Task Name** and **Execution Role** (used by ECS to pull images from ECR).  
4. Configure **Container Definitions**:  
   - Add a **Container Name** (e.g., `microservice-app`).  
   - Provide the **Docker Image URL** (e.g., `123456789.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/microservice:latest`).  
   - Allocate **CPU and Memory** based on app requirements.  
   - Define **Port Mappings** (e.g., `8080` for web apps).  
   - Set **Environment Variables**, **Logging**, and **Health Checks**.  
5. Click **Create Task Definition**.

### **2. Configure the Service**  
A **Service** ensures that the specified number of tasks (containers) are running and automatically replaces failed tasks.  

#### **Steps to Create an ECS Service**:  
1. Go to **ECS Console** → **Clusters** → Select your Cluster → **Create Service**.  
2. Select **Launch Type**:  
   - **EC2** (if using your own EC2 instances)  
   - **Fargate** (if running serverless containers)  
3. Choose **Task Definition** and set the **Number of Tasks**.  
4. Select a **Load Balancer** (Application Load Balancer - ALB, if needed).  
5. Enable **Auto Scaling** (optional).  
6. Click **Create Service**.  

---

### **3. Deploy the Service**  
Once the service is created, ECS automatically deploys and starts the specified number of **tasks** (containers).  

#### **Check Deployment Status**:  
1. Go to **ECS Console** → **Clusters** → Select your Cluster → **Services**.  
2. Verify that tasks are running successfully.  
3. Click on **Tasks** to inspect logs, environment variables, and resource utilization.  

---

### **4. Access the Application**  
You can access the deployed microservice via:  

1. **Public IP Address (for EC2-based deployments)**:  
   - Get the **public IP** of an EC2 instance from the ECS Console.  
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8080`.  

2. **Using Application Load Balancer (ALB) (for Fargate-based deployments)**:  
   - Find the **ALB DNS Name** under **EC2 Console** → **Load Balancers**.  
   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://<ALB-DNS-Name>:8080`.  

---

### **5. Monitor Cluster, Service**  
To ensure the health of your application, you can monitor ECS using AWS services:  

1. **ECS Service Metrics**:  
   - Go to **ECS Console** → **Clusters** → Select your Cluster → **Services**.  
   - Check the **running task count, pending tasks, and CPU/memory utilization**.  

2. **AWS CloudWatch Metrics**:  
   - Navigate to **CloudWatch Console** → **Metrics** → **ECS**.  
   - View metrics like CPU/Memory usage, request latency, and task restarts.  

3. **AWS X-Ray for Distributed Tracing (Optional)**:  
   - Enable **X-Ray** in ECS to trace microservice request flows.  

---

### **6. Capture Application/Container Logs using CloudWatch**  
To capture logs from ECS tasks:  

#### **Enable CloudWatch Logging for ECS Tasks**  
1. Go to **ECS Console** → **Task Definitions**.  
2. Edit the **Container Definition** and scroll to **Log Configuration**.  
3. Select **AWS CloudWatch Logs** and provide a **Log Group Name** (e.g., `/ecs/microservice`).  
4. Save and **Update the Task Definition**.  

#### **View Logs in CloudWatch**  
1. Go to **CloudWatch Console** → **Logs** → **Log Groups**.  
2. Select the log group `/ecs/microservice`.  
3. View real-time logs from running containers.  


## **Troubleshooting ECS Agent Issues in Linux (Amazon ECS on EC2)**  

The **ECS agent** is responsible for communicating between your EC2 instances and the AWS ECS control plane. If your containers are not registering, failing to start, or the ECS service isn't working as expected, follow this troubleshooting guide.

## **1. Check ECS Agent Status**  
Run the following command to check if the ECS agent is running:  
```bash
sudo systemctl status ecs
```
OR  
```bash
docker ps | grep ecs-agent
```
If the agent is not running, start it using:  
```bash
sudo systemctl start ecs
```
OR (if using older Amazon Linux AMI)  
```bash
sudo start ecs
```

---

## **2. Restart the ECS Agent**  
If the agent is unresponsive or behaving incorrectly, restart it:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ecs
```
OR  
```bash
sudo stop ecs && sudo start ecs
```

---

## **3. Check ECS Agent Logs**  
Logs provide valuable insights into ECS agent failures. Check the logs with:  
```bash
sudo cat /var/log/ecs/ecs-agent.log | less
```
Look for errors like:  
- `"Failed to register container instance"`
- `"ECS Agent stopped"`
- `"Task stopped unexpectedly"`

If there are permission errors, check IAM role assignments.

---

## **4. Verify ECS Agent Connectivity**  
The ECS agent requires internet access to communicate with AWS ECS. Run:  
```bash
curl -v https://ecs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
If the request fails:  
- Ensure the **instance has internet access** (public IP or NAT Gateway).  
- Check **Security Groups** (allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port 443).  
- Verify **VPC and Subnet** configurations.  

---

## **5. Ensure Correct ECS Cluster Name**  
If the ECS agent fails to register the instance, confirm that the correct cluster name is set:  
```bash
cat /etc/ecs/ecs.config
```
It should contain:  
```bash
ECS_CLUSTER=your-cluster-name
```
If incorrect, update it and restart the agent:  
```bash
echo "ECS_CLUSTER=your-cluster-name" | sudo tee -a /etc/ecs/ecs.config
sudo systemctl restart ecs
```

---

## **6. Verify IAM Role Permissions**  
The ECS instance must have an IAM role with the correct permissions.  

### **Check IAM Role Attached to Instance**  
Run:  
```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
```
Ensure the IAM role has the **AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role** policy attached.

If missing, attach the following policy in the AWS Console:  
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "ecs:CreateCluster",
    "ecs:RegisterContainerInstance",
    "ecs:DeregisterContainerInstance",
    "ecs:DiscoverPollEndpoint",
    "ecs:Submit*",
    "ecs:Poll",
    "ecs:StartTelemetrySession",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

---

## **7. Reinstall the ECS Agent (if necessary)**  
If the agent is corrupted or missing, reinstall it:  
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y ecs-init
sudo systemctl enable ecs
sudo systemctl start ecs
```

For **Ubuntu/Debian**:  
```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y amazon-ecs-init
sudo systemctl enable ecs
sudo systemctl start ecs
```

---

## **8. Verify Docker is Running**  
Since the ECS agent runs as a Docker container, ensure Docker is installed and running:  
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```
If it’s not running, restart Docker:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

---

## **9. Check Disk Space & Memory Usage**  
Low disk space or memory can cause ECS agent failures. Check usage:  
```bash
df -h   # Check disk space
free -m # Check memory usage
```
If disk space is low, clean up unused Docker images and containers:  
```bash
docker system prune -a
```

---

## **10. Verify ECS Metadata Endpoint**  
Check if the ECS agent can retrieve metadata:  
```bash
curl http://localhost:51678/v1/metadata
```
Expected output:  
```json
{
  "Cluster": "your-cluster-name",
  "ContainerInstanceArn": "arn:aws:ecs:region:account-id:container-instance/container-id"
}
```
If this fails, restart the agent and verify your **ECS_CLUSTER** configuration.

---

## **Final Steps: If Issues Persist**  
- Run the ECS diagnostic command:  
  ```bash
  sudo ecs-agent-exec --ecs-exec-id diagnostics
  ```
- Check **AWS ECS Console** → **Clusters** → Check if the instance is registered.  
- If all else fails, **deregister and re-register the instance**:  
  ```bash
  sudo stop ecs
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/ecs/data/ecs_agent_data.json
  sudo start ecs
  ```
