# Set up AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)

## Step 1: Enable AWS IAM Identity Center

1. **Log in to AWS Console** with administrator credentials.
2. Navigate to **AWS IAM Identity Center** service (formerly called AWS Single Sign-On).
3. Click **Enable AWS IAM Identity Center** (if not already enabled).

---

## Step 2: Choose Your Identity Source

AWS IAM Identity Center lets you manage users from either:

* **AWS IAM Identity Center directory (built-in)** — create and manage users/groups directly in AWS
* **External Identity Provider** — connect your corporate directory via SAML 2.0 or AWS Managed Microsoft AD

To configure:

1. In IAM Identity Center console, go to **Settings**.
2. Under **Identity Source**, choose one of the following:

* **AWS IAM Identity Center** (default) — Use this if you want to create users inside AWS IAM Identity Center.
* **Active Directory** — Choose this to connect to AWS Managed Microsoft AD or your on-prem AD via AD Connector.
* **External Identity Provider** — Use SAML 2.0 federation (like Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

3. Follow the prompts based on your choice.

## Step 3: Create Users and Groups (If Using Built-in Directory)

1. Go to **Users** tab and click **Add user**.
2. Provide username, email, and optionally set up initial password.
3. Create **Groups** as needed for easier permission management.
4. Add users to relevant groups.

---

## Step 4: Connect AWS Accounts (If Using AWS Organizations)

1. In the IAM Identity Center console, go to **AWS Accounts** tab.
2. You should see all AWS accounts under your AWS Organization listed.
3. If not linked, follow instructions to link your AWS Organization.
4. Select the accounts you want to manage via IAM Identity Center.
5. Click **Enable** for those accounts.

---

## Step 5: Create Permission Sets

Permission sets define what AWS permissions a user or group has in an account.

1. Go to the **Permission Sets** tab.
2. Click **Create permission set**.
3. Choose a template or create a **custom permission set**:

   * Select **AWS managed policies** (e.g., AdministratorAccess, ReadOnlyAccess)
   * Or create **custom policies** by pasting your own JSON IAM policy.
4. Set session duration (e.g., 1 hour, 12 hours).
5. Optionally configure relay state URLs and tags.
6. Save the permission set.

---

## Step 6: Assign Users or Groups to AWS Accounts

1. Go to **AWS Accounts** tab.
2. Select an AWS account.
3. Click **Assign users**.
4. Select users or groups.
5. Choose the **Permission Set** you created earlier.
6. Confirm the assignment.

Users will get access to that account with the specified permissions.

---

## Step 7: User Access & Sign-in

1. Share the **AWS IAM Identity Center User Portal URL** with your users (found in the IAM Identity Center console).
2. Users sign in with their credentials.
3. They will see the list of AWS accounts and applications assigned to them.
4. Selecting an account/app signs them in with the appropriate permissions — no need to enter separate AWS credentials.

---

## Optional Step 8: Configure Application Access (SSO to SaaS apps)

1. Go to **Applications** tab.
2. Click **Add application**.
3. Choose from a list of pre-integrated apps (like Salesforce, Office 365) or add a custom SAML 2.0 app.
4. Configure application-specific SSO settings.
5. Assign users/groups access to applications.

---

## Optional Step 9: Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

1. In IAM Identity Center **Settings**, enable MFA enforcement.
2. Users will be prompted to register MFA devices on their next login for added security.
