### What is **AWS IAM Identity Center**?

AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) is a cloud service that enables you to centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications for your users.

It provides **single sign-on** (SSO) access, so users can log in once and access all assigned AWS accounts, cloud applications, and custom applications without needing to sign in multiple times.

### Key Features of AWS IAM Identity Center:

* **Centralized User Access Management**
  Manage users and their permissions for multiple AWS accounts and applications from a single place.

* **Integration with AWS Organizations**
  Easily assign permissions across all accounts within your AWS Organization.

* **Support for External IdPs**
  Connect with external identity providers (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory, Okta, Azure AD) via SAML 2.0 for user authentication.

* **Built-in Directory**
  You can use the built-in directory to create and manage users and groups without needing an external directory.

* **Permission Sets**
  Create reusable permission sets (based on IAM policies) and assign them to users/groups per AWS account.

* **Application Access**
  Provides SSO for many business applications like Salesforce, Office 365, Slack, and custom SAML 2.0 apps.

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
  Supports MFA to improve security of user logins.

* **Audit and Compliance**
  Integration with AWS CloudTrail lets you track user sign-in and access activity.


### How it works (High-Level):

1. **Users are provisioned** in IAM Identity Center or synchronized from an external IdP.
2. **Users sign in** once to the IAM Identity Center user portal.
3. Users see all AWS accounts and applications they have permissions for.
4. Selecting an account or app lets them access it with the appropriate permissions, without needing separate logins.


### Benefits

* Simplifies access management for multiple AWS accounts and apps.
* Improves security by centralizing and standardizing authentication.
* Enhances user productivity with seamless single sign-on experience.
* Reduces operational overhead for IT teams.


### Typical Use Cases

* Enterprises managing multiple AWS accounts.
* Organizations wanting centralized access control and user lifecycle management.
* Companies using both AWS cloud and SaaS business applications needing unified access.
* Teams requiring integration with corporate directories.
